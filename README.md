# RandomizerUI
A streamlined UI built for random spawn Zelda runs. Easily toggle items, equipment, and progression elements on and off as you play, keeping track of what you’ve collected and what’s still missing. The interface automatically updates your run overview so you can focus on exploring instead of note-taking.
